about.article_text_1 = We now have over 434,000 books in our collection. Of these, 119,000 are books that \
  can be read for free, just register. The Sherlock catalog now includes all a collection of publications from the LitRes \
  bookstore, and we are constantly working to ensure that the catalog\
  more and more publishing houses and authors appeared.\
  Tens of thousands of books is an impressive number, but still very few compared to hundreds of thousands.\
  The books that are only available in hard copy. If you represent a publishing house that wants to \
  open your books to readers by subscription, or you are an author who wants to get into the library,\
  bypassing the usual publishing houses - write to us.\
  If you represent a copyright holder and have questions about book rights and/or\
  distributing them through Sherlock, ask a question by mail, we will definitely answer..
about.article_text_2 = We, like in a regular library, need registration so that we know exactly which books\
  you read, and from tens of thousands of books could offer something that is right for you. After\
  registration, you can immediately start reading any book - there is a trial fragment for almost every book,\
  so that you can flip through and try out this or that book for free before subscribing.\
  Add the books you like to your reading list, pay for a subscription, and that's it - books in your\
  until the end of the paid time. They can be read on the site through a browser, use\
  app for iPhone and iPad or app for Android.\
  Many of the books in the free set you can read without a subscription, such as classics and editions,\
  which authors and publishers have allowed to read without payment. There are more than 119,000 of them, so if you have\
  the subscription has ended, but you want to read it - pay attention to them or re-read something \
  from timeless classics.
